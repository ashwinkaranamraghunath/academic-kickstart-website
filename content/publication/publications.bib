abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s). Background: Pharmacokinetic studies are vital in development and optimization of drugs. While blood samples can be collected either in EDTA, heparin or citrate containing tubes for the estimation of drug levels in plasma, EDTA tubes are more commonly used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants on bioanalysis of drugs. Six drugs used extensively in cancer therapy were selected. Albino wistar rats (N = 6 per drug) were dosed with one of the following drugs intraperitoneally—pemetrexed (50 mg/kg), imatinib (50 mg/kg), erlotinib (25 mg/kg), meropenem (60 mg/kg), 6-mercaptopurine (20 mg/kg) and voriconazole (6 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected 2 h after dosing (1 h in 6-mercaptopurine group due to short half-life) by terminal bleeding from the retro-orbital plexus. Blood was collected in each of Disodium ETDA, heparin, trisodium citrate (TSC) and no anticoagulant (plain) tubes. Drug levels in these samples were determined by validated HPLC assays. ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test was performed to identify statistically significant differences in drug concentrations in anticoagulant tubes. p {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Significant differences in concentration between anticoagulant tubes was observed in case of erlotinib (p = 0.013) and meropenem (p = 0.00), while borderline statistical significance for pemetrexed (p = 0.076). TSC tubes overestimated erlotinib levels, heparin tubes underestimated meropenem concentrations and EDTA tubes overestimated pemetrexed concentrations. Conclusions: Careful selection of anti-coagulant is necessary for accurate characterization of pharmacokinetics of drugs. Routine use of EDTA tubes may lead to erroneous interpretation of pharmacokinetic data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: Rituximab (MabThera™, Roche) is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 surface antigen on normal and neoplastic B cells. It revolutionized the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with superior progression-free and overall survival. However, its prohibitively high cost makes it inaccessible to majority of patients in developing countries. Reditux™ (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India), a biosimilar, was introduced in India in 2007 at nearly half the price of the innovator. However, there is a dearth of data regarding the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Reditux™. Methods: Twenty-one patients of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on R-CHOP regimen were enrolled for the study. Reditux™ was administered as a slow intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed at pre-dose, post-infusion, 24, 48 h, 7 and 21 days. Rituximab levels were estimated by ELISA. Population pharmacokinetics was performed using NONMEM. In addition, B-cell count was determined at baseline and days 3 and 21 of the first cycle. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier plots. Results: The volume of distribution of central compartment and clearance of Reditux™ were estimated at 0.95 L and 5.98 mL/h, respectively. No covariate effects were seen. B-cell count was completely depleted by day 3 and remained so on day 21. Overall survival was 84.6 {\%} at a median follow-up of 36 months. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetic profile and B-cell response to Reditux™ are comparable with those reported for MabThera™. Thus, MabThera™ can be substituted with Reditux™ for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine how early lamotrigine clearance (LTG-CL/F) increases during early pregnancy in women with epilepsy and to quantify the relationship of LTG-CL/F to estradiol concentrations and gestational week. METHODS This was a multicenter, observational study of pregnant women with epilepsy on lamotrigine and no interacting concomitant medications, employing frequent blood sampling prior to and early in pregnancy. A population mixed-effects modeling approach was used to describe the relationship between LTG-CL/F and gestational week and between LTG-CL/F and estradiol. Akaike information criterion (AIC) compared goodness of fit between final models and a generalized estimating equation to compare differences between low and high percentage LTG-CL/F change groups (p {\textless} 0.05). RESULTS Twenty-five pregnancies (22 participants) were available. Increases in LTG-CL/F were present at 5 weeks gestational age. Both estradiol and gestational week were highly correlated with LTG-CL/F changes; LTG-CL/F increased at the rate of 0.115l/h for every gestational week and 0.844l/h for every 1ng/ml of estradiol, with women in the high LTG-CL/F percentage change group changing at a faster rate (p {\textless} 0.001). Models using gestational week performed better than models using estradiol. INTERPRETATION Gestational week was a better predictor of changes in LTG-CL/F than estradiol concentration and may reflect additional factors, although neither was robust enough to use clinically due to substantial interpatient variability. Changes in LTG-CL/F begin as early as the 5th gestational week, often before women know they are pregnant, emphasizing the importance of planning and early detection of pregnancy and consideration of early implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring.

abstract = {About 80{\%} of the consumers worldwide use herbal medicine (HMs) or other natural products. The percentage may vary significantly (7{\%}-55{\%}) among pregnant women, depending upon social status, ethnicity, and cultural traditions. This manuscript discusses the most common HMs used by pregnant women, and the potential interactions of HMs with conventional drugs in some medical conditions that occur during pregnancy (e.g., hypertension, asthma, epilepsy). It also includes an examination of the characteristics of pregnant HM consumers, the primary conditions for which HMs are taken, and a discussion related to the potential toxicity of HMs taken during pregnancy. Many cultures have used HMs in pregnancy to improve wellbeing of the mother and/or baby, or to help decrease nausea and vomiting, treat infection, ease gastrointestinal problems, prepare for labor, induce labor, or ease labor pains. One of the reasons why pregnant women use HMs is an assumption that HMs are safer than conventional medicine. However, for pregnant women with pre-existing conditions like epilepsy and asthma, supplementation of conventional treatment with HMs may further complicate their care. The use of HMs is frequently not reported to healthcare professionals. Providers are often not questioning HM use, despite little being known about the HM safety and HM-drug interactions during pregnancy. This lack of knowledge on potential toxicity and the ability to interact with conventional treatments may impact both mother and fetus. There is a need for education of women and their healthcare professionals to move away from the idea of HMs not being harmful. Healthcare professionals need to question women on whether they use any HMs or natural products during pregnancy, especially when conventional treatment is less efficient and/or adverse events have occurred as herbal-drug interactions could be the reason for these observations. Additionally, more preclinical and clinical studies are needed to evaluate HM efficacy and toxicity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate bupivacaine concentrations in maternal plasma and transfer into breast milk in women undergoing liposomal bupivacaine infiltration in the transversus abdominis plane after cesarean birth. METHODS Prospective cohort study of healthy pregnant women who underwent cesarean birth at term followed by a transversus abdominis plane block using 52 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.25{\%} (20 mL) and 266 mg liposomal bupivacaine 1.3{\%} (20 mL). Simultaneous blood and milk samples were collected in a staggered fashion, three to four samples per patient at the following timepoints after block administration: 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Quantification of bupivacaine was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Neonatal drug exposure was modeled by calculating milk/plasma area under the curve (AUC) ratios, neonatal dosage, and relative neonatal dosage of bupivacaine at each sampling time. RESULTS Thirty patients were enrolled. Concentrations in breast milk peaked at 6 hours (mean 58 ng/mL), followed by constant and steady decline to low levels at 96 hours (mean 5.2 ng/mL). Maternal plasma concentrations had two peaks, first at 6 hours (mean 155.9 ng/mL) and then at 48 hours (mean 225.8 ng/mL), followed by steady decline. Milk/plasma AUC0-t ratios ranged between AUC0-2 of 0.45 (80{\%} CI 0.38-0.52) and AUC0-96 of 0.15 (80{\%} CI 0.14-0.17). Neonatal dosage ranged between a mean of 355.9 ng/kg at 0-2 hours and a mean of 15,155.4 ng/kg at 0-96 hours. Relative neonatal dosage was less than 1{\%} at all time intervals. No serious adverse reactions occurred in any neonate. CONCLUSION Bupivacaine is excreted in breast milk after local infiltration of liposomal bupivacaine and bupivacaine hydrochloride mixture into transversus abdominis plane blocks after cesarean birth. Relative neonatal dosages of less than 1{\%} (less than 10{\%} is considered to be unlikely to be of clinical concern) suggest minimal risks for breastfeeding healthy, term neonates after the administration of this combination of local anesthetics to mothers.
