Purpose: Rituximab (MabThera™, Roche) is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 surface antigen on normal and neoplastic B cells. It revolutionized the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with superior progression-free and overall survival. However, its prohibitively high cost makes it inaccessible to majority of patients in developing countries. Reditux™ (Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India), a biosimilar, was introduced in India in 2007 at nearly half the price of the innovator. However, there is a dearth of data regarding the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of Reditux™. Methods: Twenty-one patients of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma on R-CHOP regimen were enrolled for the study. Reditux™ was administered as a slow intravenous infusion at a dose of 375 mg/m2on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed at pre-dose, post-infusion, 24, 48 h, 7 and 21 days. Rituximab levels were estimated by ELISA. Population pharmacokinetics was performed using NONMEM. In addition, B-cell count was determined at baseline and days 3 and 21 of the first cycle. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier plots. Results: The volume of distribution of central compartment and clearance of Reditux™ were estimated at 0.95 L and 5.98 mL/h, respectively. No covariate effects were seen. B-cell count was completely depleted by day 3 and remained so on day 21. Overall survival was 84.6 % at a median follow-up of 36 months. Conclusion: The pharmacokinetic profile and B-cell response to Reditux™ are comparable with those reported for MabThera™. Thus, MabThera™ can be substituted with Reditux™ for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas.},
